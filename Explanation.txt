The problems with data were:
1. There were people without a car with car paint
2. There were people in the friendship table for whom no friend appeared

Fixing the above problems:
1. No car color was entered for them - just like for a person without a car in the "student" table
2. This friendships will not be included in the "friendships" table

Accordingly, for the "friendships" table I defined that the 2 IDs of the members are defined as
FOREIGN KEY for their ID in the "students" table and according to the ID they were also defined
as NOT NULL - meaning that there are necessarily two members. The reason for the connection
is that each column in the "friendships" table is an ID of a student that exists in the "student" table.
